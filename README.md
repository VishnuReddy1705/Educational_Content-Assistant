## 📄 Project Overview

In the modern educational landscape, students face a critical challenge: **Information Overload**. Textbooks are dense (500+ pages), search is inefficient, and standard AI tools often "hallucinate" or lack specific context.

The **Educational Content Assistant** solves this by creating a "Knowledge Bridge." It ingests specific educational material (PDFs), indexes them into a semantic vector space, and uses a custom **ScaleDown™ Engine** to compress complex topics into digestible insights without losing pedagogical value.

### Problem Statement
Traditional education relies heavily on static, voluminous textbooks. Students often struggle with:
* **Passive Learning:** Reading without active engagement leads to poor retention.
* **Search Inefficiency:** Inability to quickly locate specific context or definitions.
* **Cognitive Load:** Difficulty identifying core concepts amidst verbose text.

### Solution
This application serves as an active study partner, offering:
1.  **Context-Aware Answers:** It doesn't just match keywords; it understands the question and retrieves precise paragraphs.
2.  **ScaleDown™ Technology:** A custom summarization engine that strips "fluff" while keeping pedagogical value.
3.  **Active Recall Tools:** Automated generation of flashcards and quizzes.
